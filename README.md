## Flow
Preconditions for flow:

1. Clear goals with immedieate feedback
2. Difficulty is near ability
3. Agency and control

## If…
- There are no clear goals (or the goal is too ambitious/has too large of a delay): remove uncertainty by narrowing scope with a minimal viable product (e.g mockup)
- You don’t know where to start: write down a tiny project specific step which is a success point and write down a clear continuation from that point
- You’re stuck on a problem: Switch to a different project/return to it later after getting some rest or ask for help (e.g on stackoverflow)
- You’re getting interrupted: Block out time and pause notifications
- The project/task feels low value: Reframe it to find some aspect that will hold your attention
- There’s anxiety as a consequence of perfectionism/high stakes: Set up a clear anchor as precedent so there’s no deliberation when the anchor cues the task. Reframe as “imperfection is excusable, incompletion is not”.
- After you reach a stopping point, it’s hard to pick up again: Create start/end ritual or note the next the thing to do or stop in the middle
